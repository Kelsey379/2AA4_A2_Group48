the takeDecision: 
1. commands that can move the drone
    create a new drone object with the 
    battery and heading 
2. store the map in an ADS? 
    need to be able to work through the json file? 
3. parse through the ADS and change the drone 
accordingly 
4. make a move ( call the takeDecision method) 
5. after every takeDecision call acknowledgeResults 

6. echo either ground or out of range 
    not if its viable spot or not 

7. scan tells the type of land it is 

8. need to find emergecny site ( return the info) 
9. need to find the creek sit ( return the info ) 
10. when u use the scan method it will automatically return 
if the type of land is emergecny or creek

REQUIRED: 

find creek, find emergecny site, avoid going MIA, produce final 
report with the inlet identifier 

when u use echo, it return ground or no ground 
but it mean that the ground can be any of the 5 biomes
so you need to go to that ground biome and use scan to determine 
which biome it is, and just because it might be a beach biome 
it does not mean that its a creek, it will have that as a 
seperate identifier
